# CS Bridge Lab Template

This repository serves as a template that the Bridge Program bases all of its labs off of. Labs are built using Maven, and the JAR produced by the build process is added to a Docker image based off of our [autograder](https://github.com/purduecsbridge/java-autograder). [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) uses this Docker image to spin up containers used to test and grade student submissions.

If you are interested in using Gradescope to test Java assignments in your course, feel free to use this template as a starting point to test things out or create new assignments.
